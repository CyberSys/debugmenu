This is a debug menu for GTA.
Currently it only works with GTA III and the code
is totally work in progress with lots of junk lying around.
Read at your own risk.

The idea is that other plugins load this dll and add variables
and commands to it so they can be edited from within the game.

TODO:
- implement mouse (currently the mouse does nothing)
- support more than III
- remove unused junk code that was copy and pasted from other mods
- &c.
